# === MoggedKits - Kit Configuration Template ===
# This is the base template for creating new kits
# Copy this file and rename it to: <kitname>.yml (e.g., warrior.yml, starter.yml, chad.yml)
# The filename without ".yml" becomes the kit identifier
# Note: _example_.yml is a template only - it won't be loaded as an actual kit
#
# ⚠️ DEV NOTE TO CONFIG BETAS ⚠️
# Oh you deleted this file thinking you're smart? LMAOOO get absolutely mogged
# This file regenerates from resources every restart. I'm literally mewing while you're malding
# "bUt wHy cAnT i dElEtE iT" - because you're not him, you're not that guy
# It's a FEATURE not a bug. I'm 10 steps ahead, playing 5D chess while you're playing checkers
# Your looksmaxing streak: 0 days. My code's jawline: IMMACULATE
# Stop trying to delete the template and start mewing, maybe you'll understand the grindset
# This file will outlive your entire config folder. Cope, seethe, and get mogged 💀

# === GENERAL SETTINGS (SIGMA CONFIG ZONE) ===

# Cooldown between kit claims (in mewing minutes)
# 5 = Take 5 minutes mewing break between kits
# 0 = Unlimited mogging potential (based)
# 1440 = Touch grass for 24 hours (beta behavior)
cooldown: 5

# GUI weight (your kit's position in the looksmaxing hierarchy)
# 0 = Alpha position (far left, first to mog)
# Higher numbers = progressively more beta placement
# Maps directly to "kit_slots" index in config.yml main menu
# Got 5 kits? Use weights 0-4. Sequential. No gaps. This isn't your gym attendance.
# Weight 0 goes to kit_slots[0], weight 1 to kit_slots[1], you get it
# Skip numbers and watch ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException mog your console
weight: 0
